Wait, looking at source 180-181: 'Pull model... happens when the lower layer gets accessible information from the higher layer'. Let's check Push model (Source 179): 'when layer J conjures a help of layer J+1, any necessary information is passed...'. Re-reading source 126: 'Base up calls can be named notices'. Source 181 text says 'lower layer gets accessible information from the higher layer'. Actually, the question describes 'lower layer sends... to higher layer'. This is often described as a callback or notification. However, looking at the definition of Pull in source 181: 'lower layer gets accessible information from the higher layer'. This implies the lower layer pulls. The Push model (source 179) describes passing info during a service call (usually top-down). Let's look at Scenario II (Source 123-126) for bottom-up. It says 'Base up calls can be named notices'. Let's look at the options provided. The standard definition of Push vs Pull in this context: Push = sender initiates transfer. Pull = receiver requests transfer. If lower layer sends info at its own discretion, it is pushing data up. The text in 6.1.7 Step 8 is slightly confusingly phrased in the OCR. Let's stick to the clear definitions in Dynamics. Scenario II describes bottom-up as 'notices'. But let's look at source 179/180 again. 'Push model... information is passed as a component of the service call'. 'Pull model... lower layer gets... from higher layer'. The question asks about lower sending to higher. This aligns with Scenario II 'notices'. However, let's try a different question to ensure accuracy based on the provided text's specific phrasing."
